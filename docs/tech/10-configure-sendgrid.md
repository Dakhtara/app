# Sendgrid

Sendgrid is the email provider: http://sendgrid.com/

Free emails (gmail, others) have delivery issues when sending thousands messages, so using a professional tool is advised with this application.

Once your account is created, go to https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys and create an API key.

### Project configuration
