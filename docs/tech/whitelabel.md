# White Labeling

You are not belonging to the Red Cross? Welcome to use the project anyway!

On April 2 and 3, BlaBlaCar allowed its employees to join
COVID-19 battle and we decided to make this project usable
by other parties than the Red Cross.

Croix-Rouge               |  Protection Civile

You can configure colors, logo and brand in the `.env`.

Structures and volunteer importation can be done by admins.
