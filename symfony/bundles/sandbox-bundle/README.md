# Sandbox

This Bundle is part of the redcall project and does not aim to provide reusable tools.

It aims to provide developer tools:

- ability to send and receive SMS on fake mobile phones

- ability to send and receive messages on fake emails

- ability to create fake volunteers

- ability to change volunteer's geolocation (for the "find my crew" feature)
